"AI Engineer specializing in LLM integration, workflow automation, and multi-agent systems. I build production-ready AI applications that handle real business workloads — not just demos."
Full About Text:
Opening Hook:
Most AI projects never make it to production. Mine do.
The Story:
I'm an AI Engineer and Automation Architect based in Hamburg, Germany. I specialize in building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between what AI can do and what businesses actually need.
My path to AI wasn't traditional. I started in mechatronics engineering in Syria, then rebuilt my career in Germany — learning the language, completing a second degree in Industrial Engineering, and working my way through robotics operations, data analytics, and consulting before finding my focus in AI product development.
What I Do Now:
At JobLeads, I design and build AI-powered applications that serve hundreds of thousands of job seekers. My systems process thousands of customer interactions daily, generate personalized coaching content at scale, and turn unstructured conversations into actionable insights.
What Makes Me Different:
I don't just build AI models — I build complete systems. From the LLM prompts to the automation workflows to the user interfaces, I handle the full stack. Every project I ship has measurable business impact: hours saved, response times cut, insights multiplied.
My Approach:
I believe in AI that augments human work rather than replacing it. The best systems I've built keep humans in the loop — using AI to handle the repetitive work so people can focus on what matters.

4. FEATURED PROJECTS
Section Header: "Selected Work"
Intro Text:
Real projects with real impact. These systems are running in production, handling thousands of interactions, and delivering measurable business results.

Project 1: Customer Support Automation System
Category Tag: AI Automation
One-liner: LLM-powered support system that generates response suggestions for customer service agents
The Challenge:
JobLeads receives hundreds of support tickets daily. Customer service agents were overwhelmed, response times were slow, and quality was inconsistent. The team needed a way to handle volume without sacrificing quality.
My Solution:
I built an intelligent automation system that processes incoming Zendesk tickets, analyzes the customer's issue, and generates suggested responses for agents to review and send.
The system doesn't auto-reply — that would be risky. Instead, it prepares draft responses as internal notes, letting agents review, edit, and approve with a single click. This keeps humans in control while dramatically reducing the time spent crafting each response.
Key Features:

Automated ticket classification and routing
LLM-generated response suggestions tailored to each issue
Risk classification system (4-tier scoring) to prioritize escalations
Human-in-the-loop approval workflow
Integration with existing Zendesk processes

Technical Implementation:

n8n workflow orchestration
Claude API for response generation
Zendesk API for ticket management
Custom prompt engineering for brand voice consistency
Webhook triggers for real-time processing

Results:

700+ tickets processed daily
60% reduction in agent response time
95%+ accuracy in risk classification
Agents can focus on complex cases while AI handles routine queries


Project 2: Employee Survey Chatbot
Category Tag: Multi-Agent AI
One-liner: Conversational AI that replaces rigid questionnaires with natural dialogue to gather deep employee feedback
The Challenge:
Traditional employee surveys suffer from low engagement and shallow responses. People click through ratings without providing the qualitative insights HR actually needs. JobLeads wanted to understand what employees really think — not just collect numbers.
My Solution:
I designed a conversational chatbot that conducts employee surveys through natural dialogue. Instead of asking "Rate your satisfaction from 1-5," it asks open-ended questions and follows up based on responses.
The system uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents analyze different dimensions of the employee experience (culture, leadership, growth, processes) while a main conversational agent maintains natural dialogue flow.
Survey Dimensions Covered:

Scaling & Operational Clarity
Remote-First Culture & Connection
Performance & Feedback
Trust & Leadership
Growth & Development

Technical Implementation:

CrewAI multi-agent framework
OpenAI GPT for conversation
Parallel agent execution for real-time analysis
Context passing between agents
Structured data extraction from unstructured conversations

Results:

10x increase in qualitative insights compared to traditional surveys
Natural conversation flow that employees actually engage with
Automated sentiment analysis and theme extraction
Actionable insights for HR without manual analysis


Project 3: Email Coaching Automation (ECC System)
Category Tag: AI Content Generation
One-liner: Automated system that generates thousands of personalized career coaching emails with A/B testing
The Challenge:
JobLeads offers premium career coaching services. Coaches needed to send personalized outreach emails to job seekers, but crafting individual emails at scale was impossible. The content needed to feel personal, not templated.
My Solution:
I built a multi-step AI pipeline that generates highly personalized coaching emails from user data. The system creates multiple variations, allows coaches to select the best approach, and handles delivery — all while maintaining a human-in-the-loop quality gate.
The Workflow:

Data Collection: System pulls user's resume, onboarding responses, and job search goals
Hook Generation: AI creates 6 different personalized "hooks" based on the user's unique situation
Coach Selection: Human coach reviews hooks and selects the best angle
Email Generation: AI generates 2 full email variants using the selected hook
A/B Selection: Coach picks the final version
Automated Delivery: System sends via email infrastructure

Technical Implementation:

OpenAI models (including o3 and o4-mini) for content generation
n8n for workflow orchestration
Microsoft Graph API for email delivery
React-based coach portal for selection interface
Excel integration for user data management

Results:

Thousands of personalized emails generated and sent
Maintained quality through human-in-the-loop approach
A/B testing improved conversion rates
Coaches focus on strategy while AI handles writing


Project 4: Voice AI Integration
Category Tag: Voice Technology
One-liner: End-to-end voice recording and transcription system integrated with chatbot infrastructure
The Challenge:
Some users prefer speaking to typing. The existing JobLeads chatbot was text-only, limiting accessibility and engagement for users who wanted voice interaction.
My Solution:
I built a complete voice pipeline that lets users record voice messages in the browser, transcribes them in real-time, and feeds the text into the existing chatbot system — creating a seamless voice-to-AI experience.
System Architecture:

Frontend: Web Audio API for browser-based recording
Transmission: Base64-encoded audio sent to backend
Transcription: OpenAI Whisper API for speech-to-text
Integration: Transcribed text flows into existing chat pipeline
Orchestration: n8n manages the entire flow

Technical Considerations:

WebM audio format (browser-native, Whisper-compatible)
Chunked processing for long recordings
Error handling for poor audio quality
25MB file limit management

Results:

Voice input option added without rebuilding the chatbot
Seamless integration with existing infrastructure
Improved accessibility for users who prefer speaking


Project 5: KPI Automation Dashboard
Category Tag: Data Automation
Company: Starship Technologies
One-liner: Automated KPI reporting system that reduced weekly processing from 4 hours to 30 minutes
The Challenge:
Starship's delivery robot operations generated massive amounts of data. Creating weekly KPI reports for the team and industrial clients required hours of manual data extraction, calculation, and formatting. The process was error-prone and consumed valuable time.
My Solution:
I built an automated reporting pipeline using Google Apps Script and SQL that pulls operational data, calculates KPIs, and generates formatted reports — transforming a 4-hour weekly task into a 30-minute review process.
What It Automates:

Delivery success rates and timing metrics
Robot autonomy performance
Fleet utilization statistics
Client-specific breakdowns
Trend analysis and anomaly flagging

Technical Implementation:

SQL queries for data extraction from Databricks
Google Apps Script for automation logic
Google Sheets for calculations and formatting
Automated email distribution
Error logging and alerting

Results:

Weekly reporting time: 4 hours → 30 minutes (87% reduction)
Eliminated manual calculation errors
Real-time fleet insights for data-driven decisions
Freed up time for strategic analysis instead of data wrangling


Project 6: Industrial Mapping App
Category Tag: Operations Tool
Company: Starship Technologies
One-liner: AppSheet-based mapping application that accelerated industrial client onboarding and saved 20-40 hours per deployment
The Challenge:
Deploying Starship's delivery robots at new industrial sites required extensive mapping work — documenting zones, paths, charging stations, and safety requirements. The process was manual, documentation was scattered, and each new site meant reinventing the wheel.
My Solution:
I built a custom mapping application using Google AppSheet that standardized the entire onboarding process. Field teams could document site details on mobile devices, data synced automatically, and all information flowed into a central system.
App Features:

Mobile-friendly interface for field mapping
Photo documentation with GPS tagging
Standardized forms for consistent data collection
Real-time sync to central Google Sheets database
Automatic report generation for clients

Technical Implementation:

Google AppSheet for mobile app development
Google Sheets as backend database
Google Apps Script for automation
Integration with mapping workflows

Results:

20-40 hours saved per client onboarding
Standardized documentation across all deployments
Reduced errors in site configuration
Faster ramp-up time for new industrial locations

Notable Deployments:

Merck KGaA Darmstadt (on-site)
Wacker Burghausen (remote)
La Roche Penzberg (remote)
Finland Launch


Project 7: Pipeline Inspection Data Analysis
Category Tag: Data Engineering
Company: EMPIT GmbH
One-liner: End-to-end data pipeline for electromagnetic inspection projects that cut validation time from hours to minutes
The Challenge:
EMPIT inspects "unpiggable" pipelines across Europe using electromagnetic technology. Each project generated massive datasets requiring cleaning, validation, spline calculations, and visualization before delivery to clients. The manual process was slow and error-prone.
My Solution:
I owned the complete data pipeline — from raw inspection data to client-ready reports. I built Python scripts for quality control, automated validation checks, and streamlined the entire workflow from field-to-report.
Pipeline Stages:

Data Ingestion: Download project and inspection data
Quality Control: Verify calibration files, check completeness
Processing: Calculate and adjust splines, sort and group data
Validation: Run automated checks, flag anomalies
Visualization: Prepare data for web-based client apps
Review: Final inspection team verification
Delivery: Upload to customer portal

Technical Implementation:

Python for data processing and validation scripts
SQL for data management
Custom monitoring app for quality control
Web-based apps for client delivery

Results:

Validation time reduced from hours to minutes per project
20+ European pipeline projects processed
Systematic QC workflows with automated error detection
Faster turnaround for client deliverables


Project 8: Risk Classification System
Category Tag: AI Classification
One-liner: LLM-powered ticket classification system with 95%+ accuracy in identifying escalation risk
The Challenge:
Not all support tickets are equal. Some customers are frustrated but patient; others are about to leave negative reviews or initiate chargebacks. The support team needed to prioritize high-risk tickets, but manually assessing escalation risk was time-consuming and inconsistent.
My Solution:
I built a risk classification system that analyzes ticket content and assigns escalation risk scores. The system uses carefully engineered prompts to detect signals of customer frustration, explicit threats, and urgency indicators.
Classification Tiers:

Score 0: Not related (system emails, non-customer messages)
Score 1: No risk (happy/neutral customers, no refund discussion)
Score 2: Low risk (polite refund requests, neutral tone)
Score 3: Medium risk (angry/frustrated, no explicit threats)
Score 4: High risk (explicit mentions of reviews, chargebacks, legal action)

Prompt Engineering Challenges Solved:

Eliminated contradictions between classification examples
Reduced overfitting to specific phrases
Balanced sensitivity vs. false positives
Handles messy ticket data (HTML, signatures, quoted threads)

Results:

95%+ accuracy in risk categorization
High-risk tickets immediately visible to team leads
Proactive intervention before escalation
Data-driven approach to customer retention
